# Release Notes v.1.5.0

In this update some minor changes were introduced and features added. The most significant adition in this update is the **Lammps Simulation Dashboard** (Still in the testing phase). Please [report issues](https://github.com/ThFriedrich/lammps_vscode/issues/new/choose) if you encounter any problems so they can be fixed. Much of the content of this extension is generated in an automated fashion from the official [Lammps documentation](https://docs.lammps.org/Manual.html). It is hardly possible to check the behaviour of autocomplete and hover features and the generation and formatting of the embedded documentation pages for each individual command, what makes bug reports all the more important and valueable. Also, please share your ideas for enhancements or new features.
