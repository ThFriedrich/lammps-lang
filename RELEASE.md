# Release Notes v.1.6.0, v.1.7.0 and v.1.8.8

In this update some minor changes were introduced and features added and bugs fixed: [#51](https://github.com/ThFriedrich/lammps_vscode/issues/51), [#49](https://github.com/ThFriedrich/lammps_vscode/issues/49), [#39](https://github.com/ThFriedrich/lammps_vscode/issues/39). This concerns issues with resolving relative file paths in the linting functions. Issue [#52](https://github.com/ThFriedrich/lammps_vscode/issues/52), introduces symbols to create an outline of the document based on folding markers. The python scripts to generate the doc_obj.ts from the online rst-files got some updates and fixes too. Further, the task provider functinality was updated to allow a better customisation of task definitions [#41](https://github.com/ThFriedrich/lammps_vscode/issues/41). A dry-run task was also added as discussed in [#11](https://github.com/ThFriedrich/lammps_vscode/issues/51). The atomic-dump viewer in the dashboard was updated to scale the plots according to the simulation box dimensions. The auto-resize feature was improved as well.

 Please [report issues](https://github.com/ThFriedrich/lammps_vscode/issues/new/choose) if you encounter any problems so they can be fixed. Much of the content of this extension is generated in an automated fashion from the official [Lammps documentation](https://docs.lammps.org/Manual.html). It is hardly possible to check the behaviour of autocomplete and hover features and the generation and formatting of the embedded documentation pages for each individual command, what makes bug reports all the more important and valueable. Also, please share your ideas for enhancements or new features.
